## Identify any blockers

### Front End Blocker

- Hook up the back end

### Back End Blocker

#### S3

- Backend Blocker: An error occurred (AccessControlListNotSupported) when calling the PutObject operation: The bucket does not allow ACLs

#### Configuration Issues

Issues to deploy the dockerize container to heroku
just accepts at every stage, when hitting the ned there is nothing there, no connection to application.

Admin, or postgres sql database there, not sure if necessary. Might be in the end of other endpoint.

Solution may need to smash the two back ends together iroiro server backend and iroiro api backend

## Day 2 Morning Parings
